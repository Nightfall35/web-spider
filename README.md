# web-spider
A lightweight web spider written in Windows Batch with PowerShell. It crawls web pages from a starting URL, downloads HTML, and extracts links up to a user-defined depth. All output is saved locally. No external dependencies requiredâ€”just run it on any Windows machine. Ideal for basic link discovery and analysis.
